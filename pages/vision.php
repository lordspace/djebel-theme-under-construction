TL;DR; Let's create a fast app/CMS inspired by WordPress' best features and with a simple plugin and theme structure.

WordPress is a great platform and even though it can solve 80% of the web development challenges it may not be a single solution for everything.
I really love simplicity and minimalism so I decided to build a new open source app that's fast, lean and inspired by some of the awesome WordPress features.

For example: hooks, shortcodes, simple plugin and theme structure

The idea is to have a fast app that can be anything - cms, blog, brochure site, landing pages and that's still simple to use, to develop and very customizable via plugins of course.
Also it can support multiple backends such as: text files, sqlite, pgsql, mysql etc. Why just limit it to MySQL/MariaDB?

The core CMS would give you these screens.
- dashboard
- posts
- pages
- media
- settings
- themes
- plugins

If you want comments: install a plugin.
if you want meta titles install a plugin
if you want multisite install a plugin
If you want multiple languages: install a plugin
if you want admin area .... install a plugin

Things I really like in WordPress
- Hooks -> it has filters and actions for lots of things
- Simple plugin and theme structure
- WP-CLI project - allows managing WP from the command line and using automation.
- Roles
- Backward compatibility
- Shortcodes
- Great Community
- WordCamps
- Local Meetups

Some developers complain about the legacy code, but WordPress is an awesome business tool that solves real problems and lots of them.
For example, Membership site, ecommerce (with WooCommerce), Blogging and so much more.

The clients want their problems solved at a good price and efficiently, ideally without reinventing the wheel most of the time.

I think because of things above allowed WP to become more than a blog or a CMS, It became a framework and a solid foundation, so others can build on top of.

P.S. I strongly believe open source and business should go hand in hand and are not mutually exclusive.
Donations are not a sustainable business model for most projects.
